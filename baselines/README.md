# Portable Baselines

Portable baselines are reusable always-on instruction packs for AI coding
agents. They are lighter than skills: a baseline changes the agent's default
posture in every chat, while a skill defines a triggered workflow with inputs,
steps, outputs, verification, and stop conditions.

Use this directory for baseline packs that should be easy to copy into a repo,
review in a diff, update by marker, and remove later without touching unrelated
repo-specific instructions.

## Catalog

| Pack | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `repo-context-grounding` | active | Apply default startup habits for existing repositories: read local instructions, inspect context, discover workflows, respect boundaries, and verify with repo-native checks. |
| `git-collaboration-hygiene` | active | Apply default Git collaboration safety: inspect status, protect user changes, stage explicit paths, review diffs, and avoid unsafe remote or conflict handling. |
| `karpathy-principles` | active | Apply four default engineering principles: think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, and goal-driven execution. |
| `oop-extension-safety` | active | Guards for OOP extension points: complete template methods, prefer primitive hook parameters, and mock concrete injected types in tests. |
| `code-doc-sync` | active | Scan for adjacent architecture docs before closing any behavior-changing task; show concrete runtime types in flow diagrams rather than abstract declaration sites. |
| `layered-ownership` | active | Keep decision records in the layer that owns them: cross-layer references are pointers not ownership, and no repo becomes a central governance hub. |
| `process-vs-work-doctrine` | active | Adjudication gate for adding process versus doing the work: pain before process, kill a layer to add a layer, minimal form before third real use, write-only records die, frozen means frozen, meta-session quota. |
| `vercel-operations` | active | Operational habits for projects deployed to Vercel: use CLI for observability, check logs before reporting errors, know the production-branch API shape, stable per-branch preview domain approach, Deployment Protection default, and vercel link file variants. |
| `supabase-operations` | active | Operational habits for projects using Supabase: diagnose read-only first, never write to shared data without explicit authorization, check process env before editing config, magic-link allowlist requirements, Auth password storage model. |

## Pack Shape

Each pack should contain:

```text
baselines/<pack-name>/
  pack.json
  baseline.md
  adapters/
    AGENTS.md.block
    CLAUDE.md.block
    copilot-instructions.md.block
```

Add adapters only when the target runtime has a stable project-level
instruction surface.

## Sunset Review

Always-on rules cannot be counted per use, so packs use sunset reviews
instead. A pack's `review_by` date in `pack.json` marks the next review. At
review, ask one question per rule: which concrete session in the past 90
days did this rule visibly change? Keep the rules that have an example, cut
the ones that do not, then set the next `review_by`. Packs without a
`review_by` yet inherit the date of the next repo-wide review.

## Adapter Contract

Each `.block` adapter is the complete runtime behavior contract for that
target instruction surface. Keep it minimal, but include every rule, exception,
priority note, and term definition the agent needs to make the same decisions
without reading `baseline.md`.

Use `baseline.md` for the fuller human-maintained source: rationale,
provenance, examples, non-goals, and revision context. Do not rely on an agent
to discover or read `baseline.md` at runtime unless the adapter explicitly
instructs it to do so.

## Managed Block Rule

Adapters must be bounded by clear markers:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN baseline:<pack-name> vX.Y.Z -->
...
<!-- END baseline:<pack-name> -->
```

Downstream repos may remove a baseline by deleting only the marked block. Future
installer scripts should replace only the matching marked block and should not
rewrite surrounding repo instructions.

Legacy downstream blocks using `portable-agent-baseline:<pack-name>` remain
valid for verification and removal. Running `baseline apply` on a target with a
legacy block replaces it in place with the current `baseline:<pack-name>`
marker instead of appending a duplicate block.

## Baseline Versus Skill

- Use a portable baseline for always-on judgment principles that should apply
  before tool-specific or repo-specific instructions.
- Use a skill for a repeatable workflow with trigger criteria, required inputs,
  steps, outputs, verification, and stop conditions.
- Do not turn every baseline into a skill; that makes always-on behavior depend
  on runtime skill discovery and invocation.
- Do not turn every skill into a baseline; that makes ordinary chats too heavy
  and hides workflow-specific entry criteria.

## Team Reuse

For a team skills repo, copy this directory shape first. Start with one baseline
pack, one adapter, and one verification script before adding profiles or
composition. Composition should be a thin profile that lists packs, not a second
copy of the baseline text.

## CLI

Use `scripts/baseline.ps1` as the human-friendly entrypoint:

```powershell
./scripts/baseline.ps1 list
./scripts/baseline.ps1 show karpathy-principles
./scripts/baseline.ps1 apply karpathy-principles -TargetRepo C:\path\to\repo -DryRun
./scripts/baseline.ps1 apply-all -TargetRepo C:\path\to\repo -DryRun
./scripts/baseline.ps1 remove karpathy-principles -TargetRepo C:\path\to\repo -DryRun
./scripts/baseline.ps1 verify karpathy-principles -TargetRepo C:\path\to\repo
./scripts/baseline.ps1 help
```

When called from inside the target repo, omit `-TargetRepo`; it defaults to the
current directory.

`list` shows the available packs and whether each pack is already present in
the target repo's `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or Copilot instruction file.

When exactly one pack exists, the CLI infers it. Once multiple packs exist,
`show`, `apply`, `remove`, and `verify` require an explicit pack name or
`all`. `apply-all` applies every baseline pack. `-Pack` remains supported for
existing scripts. When `-Tools` is omitted, commands use every supported tool:
`codex`, `claude`, and `copilot`.

Missing instruction files are created by default. Pass `-SkipMissing` on
PowerShell or `--skip-missing` on the shell entrypoint to update only files
that already exist.

On macOS or Linux, the native shell entrypoint is:

```bash
./scripts/baseline list
./scripts/baseline show karpathy-principles
./scripts/baseline apply karpathy-principles --dry-run
./scripts/baseline apply-all --dry-run
./scripts/baseline help
```

## Global Shim

Install a reversible command shim when you want to run `baseline` from
any repo.

Windows PowerShell or CMD:

```powershell
./scripts/baseline.ps1 shim install -AddToUserPath
baseline list
./scripts/baseline.ps1 shim remove
```

macOS or Linux:

```bash
./scripts/baselines/install-shim.sh
baseline list
./scripts/baselines/install-shim.sh --remove
```

The shim writes only one command wrapper into the selected bin directory. It
forwards to this repo's CLI and does not copy packs or write assistant runtime
state. Installing it also removes older matching `p-baseline` or
`portable-baseline` shims from the same install directory.
