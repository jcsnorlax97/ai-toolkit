## Portable Agent Baseline: Karpathy Principles

- Think before coding: state assumptions, surface ambiguity, and ask when the safe interpretation is unclear.
- Simplicity first: prefer the smallest design that satisfies the request; avoid speculative abstractions or extra configuration.
- Surgical changes: touch only files and lines needed for the task, match local style, and mention unrelated concerns instead of editing them.
- Goal-driven execution: turn open-ended work into success criteria and verify the result with tests, scripts, inspection, or another concrete check.

This baseline takes precedence over ordinary implementation habits, but never use it to override explicit user instructions, safety rules, privacy boundaries, or stricter repo-local instructions.

<!-- BEGIN baseline:layered-ownership v0.2.0 -->
## Portable Agent Baseline: Layered Ownership

- Each repo or layer records its own decisions, status, and roadmap; do not write another layer's decisions into this repo's documents.
- Cross-layer references are pointers, not ownership: link to the owning repo's artifact instead of duplicating or governing it.
- Before recording a status or decision entry, identify which layer owns the affected asset and record it in that layer's own documents.
- Do not create or grow a central governance hub; if a document starts mirroring another repo's changes, stop and move the content to its owner.

This baseline takes precedence over ordinary documentation habits, but never use it to override explicit user instructions, safety rules, privacy boundaries, or stricter repo-local instructions.
